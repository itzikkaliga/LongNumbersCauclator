# Long Numbers Cauclator
A http API for adding and multipliy 2 long numbers

##How to run it?
Simply pull this repository from your VS
and run the project.

##How to Cauclate?
After you runnig the code an internet page will pop up,
all you need to do is to copy the url and add your action.
For example to add two long numbers we send:
```
{copy url}/api/sum?numA={firstNumber}&numB={secondNumber}
```
To multipliy:
```
{copy url}/api/multipliy?numA={firstNumber}&numB={secondNumber}
```
After that it will show you your result on the screen(if you give two valid numbers).

##Challenges
My biggest challenge was to create this http API
mainly beacuse I didn't do that before.
If I had some more time I would want to design it much better.

This whole project was written in c#
and I started it at sunday morning 
and finish it at monday evening.
